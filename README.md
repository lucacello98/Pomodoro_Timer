** Pomodoro Timer (Tkinter)**

A simple yet functional **Pomodoro Timer** built using **Python's Tkinter** library. This timer helps you stay productive by following the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused work followed by short breaks, with a longer break after four sessions.



**##  Features**

- 25-minute work sessions
- 5-minute short breaks
- 20-minute long break after 4 work sessions
- Automatic transition between sessions
- Visual checkmarks to track completed work cycles
- Start and Reset buttons
- Clean and responsive UI using `tkinter`

**##  How It Works**

The timer loops through the following:
1. Work → Short Break → Work → Short Break → ...
2. After four work sessions, it starts a **long break**.
3. ✔️ Checkmarks appear at the bottom after each completed **work session**.

##  Getting Started

- Python 3.x installed
